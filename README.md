Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a solid background in computer networking and security, having acquired several certifications, including CCNA and CompTIA A+. I enjoy creating solutions that focus on network administration, organization, and user experience, as seen by my work on NexScholar, a website prototype that garnered me third place in a class competition. I am enthusiastic about learning and always honing my abilities in cybersecurity, network administration, and system analysis.

Let us work together to create something truly extraordinary!
